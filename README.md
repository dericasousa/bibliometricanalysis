# Bibliometric Analysis Project - Change Detection in Remote Sensing

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis in the field of "Change Detection" in Remote Sensing. Change detection is a critical research area within the context of Remote Sensing, playing a fundamental role in monitoring and understanding changes occurring in landscapes, environments, and natural phenomena over time.

Bibliometric analysis, a quantitative methodology that investigates the production, distribution, and impact of scientific publications, is essential for identifying trends, emerging themes, and significant influences in the field. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and descriptive statistics to data collected from the Scopus database, this project aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, professionals, and decision-makers involved in the field of Remote Sensing.

The dataset used in this project includes detailed information about scientific articles related to "Change Detection" and "Remote Sensing," covering aspects such as titles, authors, keywords, affiliations, citations, and funding details. Through exploratory analysis, topic modeling, and visualizations, we aim to:

- Identify the key research topics addressed in the scientific literature.
- Analyze the temporal evolution of publications and identify trends over time.
- Identify prominent authors and institutions in the field.
- Investigate patterns of collaboration among researchers and institutions.
- Evaluate the impact and relevance of articles based on citations.

It is expected that this bibliometric analysis will contribute to the deepening of knowledge in the field of Change Detection in Remote Sensing, supporting future research, decision-making, and development strategies in this multidisciplinary and dynamic field.

Note: This project is purely analytical and does not involve the production of new data or original research. All information used is extracted from publicly available sources.
